# Aventyr
A 2D portal game I am working on.

A quick demo of the physics engine is available here:

##Quick start
If you want to look around, your best bet is to run the EditorWindow project (it should be the default).  It's a WIP level editor for Aventyr that lets you place blocks and portals and then run the simulation.

If you are running Windows 7 or 10 then it *should* compile without any issues.  The game itself is intended to be cross-platform though since the level editor uses WPF it will be confined to Windows only.
